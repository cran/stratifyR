\title{To calculate the stratum sample sizes (nh) for a fixed sample size (n) 
directly based on the data}
\usage{
data.alloc(data, my_env)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A vector: provided as an input to the function}

\item{my_env}{The environment my_env has various constants and outputs stored
from earlier operations through various other functions}
}
\value{
\code{} calculates and stores quantities such as nh, Nh, Vh, etc.
in the my_env to be accessed and printed as outputs
}
